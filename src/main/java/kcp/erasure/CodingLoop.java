     * All of the available coding loop algorithms.
     *
     * The different choices nest the three loops in different orders,
     * and either use the log/exponents tables, or use the multiplication
     * table.
     *
     * The naming of the three loops is (with number of loops in benchmark):
     *
     *    "byte"   - Index of byte within shard.  (200,000 bytes in each shard)
     *
     *    "input"  - Which input shard is being read.  (17 data shards)
     *
     *    "output"  - Which output shard is being computed.  (3 parity shards)
     *
     * And the naming for multiplication method is:
     *
     *    "table"  - Use the multiplication table.
     *
     *    "exp"    - Use the logarithm/exponent table.
     *
     * The ReedSolomonBenchmark class compares the performance of the different
     * loops, which will depend on the specific processor you're running on.
     *
     * This is the inner loop.  It needs to be fast.  Be careful
     * if you change it.
     *
     * I have tried inlining Galois.multiply(), but it doesn't
     * make things any faster.  The JIT compiler is known to inline
     * methods, so it's probably already doing so.
