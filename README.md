## Quick setup guide

**Note:** For support please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/T5vZU6UyeG).

### Requirements

* Java SE - 17 ([link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html))

  **Note:** If you just want to **run it**, then **jre** only is fine.

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (recommended 4.0+)

* Proxy daemon: mitmproxy (mitmdump, recommended), Fiddler Classic, etc.

### Running

**Note:** If you updated from an older version, delete `config.json` to regenerate it.

1. Get `grasscutter.jar`
   - Download from [actions](https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/suites/6895963598/artifacts/267483297)
   - [Build by yourself](#Building)
2. Create a `resources` folder in the directory where grasscutter.jar is located and move your `BinOutput` and `ExcelBinOutput` folders there *(Check the [wiki](https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/wiki) for more details how to get those.)*
3. Run Grasscutter with `java -jar grasscutter.jar`. **Make sure mongodb service is running as well.**

### Connecting with the client

½. Create an account using [server console command](https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/wiki/Commands#targeting).

1. Redirect traffic: (choose one)
    - mitmdump: `mitmdump -s proxy.py -k`

      Trust CA certificate:

      ​	**Note:** The CA certificate is usually stored in `%USERPROFILE%\ .mitmproxy`, or you can download it from `http://mitm.it`

      ​	Double click for [install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skype-sdk/sdn/articles/installing-the-trusted-root-certificate#installing-a-trusted-root-certificate) or ...

      - Via command line

        ```shell
        certutil -addstore root %USERPROFILE%\.mitmproxy\mitmproxy-ca-cert.cer
        ```

    - Fiddler Classic: Run Fiddler Classic, turn on `Decrypt https traffic` in setting and change the default port there (Tools -> Options -> Connections) to anything other than `8888`, and load [this script](https://github.lunatic.moe/fiddlerscript).

    - [Hosts file](https://github.com/Melledy/Grasscutter/wiki/Running#traffic-route-map)

2. Set network proxy to `127.0.0.1:8080` or the proxy port you specified.

**you can also use `start.cmd` to start servers and proxy daemons automatically, but you have to set up JAVA_HOME enviroment**

### Building

Grasscutter uses Gradle to handle dependencies & building.

**Requirements:**

- [Java SE Development Kits - 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

##### Windows

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter.git
cd Grasscutter
.\gradlew.bat # Setting up environments
.\gradlew jar # Compile
```

##### Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter.git
cd Grasscutter
chmod +x gradlew
./gradlew jar # Compile
```

You can find the output jar in the root of the project folder.

### Commands have moved to the [wiki](https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/wiki/Commands)!

# Quick Troubleshooting

* If compiling wasn't successful, please check your JDK installation (JDK 17 and validated JDK's bin PATH variable)
* My client doesn't connect, doesn't login, 4206, etc... - Mostly your proxy daemon setup is *the issue*, if using
  Fiddler make sure it running on another port except 8888
* Startup sequence: MongoDB > Grasscutter > Proxy daemon (mitmdump, fiddler, etc.) > Game
