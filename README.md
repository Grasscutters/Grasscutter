**Attention:** We always welcome contributors to the project. Before adding your contribution, please carefully read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/blob/stable/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Current features

* Logging in
* Combat
* Friends list
* Teleportation
* Gacha system
* Co-op *partially* works
* Spawning monsters via console
* Inventory features (recieving items/characters, upgrading items/characters, etc)

## Quick setup guide

**Note:** For support please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/T5vZU6UyeG).

### Requirements

* Java SE - 17 ([link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html))

  **Note:** If you just want to **run it**, then **jre** only is fine.

* MongoDB (recommended 4.0+)

* Proxy daemon: mitmproxy (mitmdump, recommended), Fiddler Classic, etc.

### Running

**Note:** If you updated from an older version, delete `config.json` to regenerate it.

1. Get `grasscutter.jar`
   - Download from [actions](https://nightly.link/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/workflows/build/stable/Grasscutter.zip)
   - [Build by yourself](#Building)
2. Create a `resources` folder in the directory where grasscutter.jar is located and move your `BinOutput` and `ExcelBinOutput` folders there *(Check the [wiki](https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/wiki) for more details how to get those.)*
3. Run Grasscutter with `java -jar grasscutter.jar`. **Make sure mongodb service is running as well.**

### Connecting with the client

½. Create an account using [server console command](#Commands).

1. Redirect traffic: (choose one)
    - mitmdump: `mitmdump -s proxy.py -k`
    
      Trust CA certificate:
    
      ​	**Note:**The CA certificate is usually stored in `% USERPROFILE%\ .mitmproxy`, or you can download it from `http://mitm.it`
    
      ​	Double click for [install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skype-sdk/sdn/articles/installing-the-trusted-root-certificate#installing-a-trusted-root-certificate) or ...
    
      - Via command line
    
        ```shell
        certutil -addstore root %USERPROFILE%\.mitmproxy\mitmproxy-ca-cert.cer
        ```
    
    - Fiddler Classic: Run Fiddler Classic, turn on `Decrypt https traffic` in setting and change the default port there (Tools -> Options -> Connections) to anything other than `8888`, and load [this script](https://github.lunatic.moe/fiddlerscript).
      
    - [Hosts file](https://github.com/Melledy/Grasscutter/wiki/Running#traffic-route-map)
    
2. Set network proxy to `127.0.0.1:8080` or the proxy port you specified.

**you can also use `start.cmd` to start servers and proxy daemons automatically**

### Building

Grasscutter uses Gradle to handle dependencies & building.

**Requirements:**

- Java SE Development Kits - 17
- Git

##### Windows

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter.git
cd Grasscutter
.\gradlew.bat # Setting up environments
.\gradlew jar # Compile
```

##### Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter.git
cd Grasscutter
chmod +x gradlew
./gradlew jar # Compile
```

You can find the output jar in the root of the project folder.

## Commands

You might want to use this command (`java -jar grasscutter.jar -handbook`) in a cmd that is in the grasscutter folder. It will create a handbook file (GM Handbook.txt) where you can find the item IDs for stuff you want

You may want to use this command (`java -jar grasscutter.jar -gachamap`) to generate a mapping file for the gacha record subsystem. The file will be generated to `GRASSCUTTER_RESOURCE/gcstatic` folder. Otherwise you may only see number IDs in the gacha record page.

There is a dummy user named "Server" in every player's friends list that you can message to use commands. Commands also work in other chat rooms, such as private/team chats. to run commands ingame, you need to add prefix `/` or `!` such as `/pos`

### Bonus

- Teleporting
  - When you want to teleport to somewhere, use the in-game marking function on Map.
    - Mark a point on the map using the fish hook marking (the last one.)
    - (Optional) rename the map marker to a number to override the default Y coordinate (height, default 300.)
    - Confirm and close the map.
    - You will see your character falling from a very high destination, exact location that you marked.
 
# Quick Troubleshooting

* If compiling wasn't successful, please check your JDK installation (JDK 17 and validated JDK's bin PATH variable)
* My client doesn't connect, doesn't login, 4206, etc... - Mostly your proxy daemon setup is *the issue*, if using
  Fiddler make sure it running on another port except 8888

* Startup sequence: Mongodb > Grasscutter > Proxy daemon (mitmdump, fiddler, etc.) > Game
